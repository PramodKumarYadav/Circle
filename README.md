# FriendCircle
This is my hobby project to fetch information about the phone calls I make to my friends and family. I am using lycamobile and thus the project is customised around it. However, I think once I am done with it, with minor modifications, you would be able to run it for your telephone statements as well.

# For now
For first POC, the focus is to make it work for custom lycamobile call statements.
