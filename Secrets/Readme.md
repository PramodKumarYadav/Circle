# Below you will find a short and detailed summary on how to set up your google contacts. 
- If you set up this option, your reports will be more richer with contact names information. Highly recommended!

# Summary: 
## Steps to create a Google project and ClientID and ClientSecret
1. Create a Google project.
2. Enable Contacts API.
3. Create oAuth credentials i.e. Client ID and Client Secret keys
4. Save the keys as a JSON file in your Secrets directory (this folder).
    - You dont have to rename the long file name (but if you want, you can. Just dont change the file extension. Keep it as .json).
    - All the files in Secrets directory (Except readme.md) are ignored. So you dont have to worry about accidentally publishing it on say github.
    - Thus your secrets are safe on your computer (as long as your computer is safe from viruses i.e.)
    - Do not add any other file here (atleast not a json file).
5. Using your clientId and Client secret Key, get a refresh token (Detailed steps are given below) .
    - Add this refresh token to your secrets json file with a key value pair 
    - looks like this (updated with dummy values): "refresh_token": "1//04abcdefghijklmopqurstuv-abcdefghijklmopqurstuv_zydfsfsdfsfsdfsdfdsfsnT68",)
    - Later goal is to eliminate this step, so that you can just work with client id and client secret. Until then use this.
6. To ensure that all your phone contacts are synced on google contacts, sync your contacts with google contacts. 
    - If you are on Iphone, follow this one time instructions to [sync your contacts from icloud to google contacts](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/import-iphone-contacts-into-gmail,news-21221.html)
    - If you are on android, checkout how to sync your contacts manually to google contacts (there are many videos on youtube. I dont have android so cant test this.)

5. ___Get a refresh token using client id and client secret and add to secrets json file.___
    * [Navigate to Google oauthplayground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ )
    - Go to settings and check option "use your own OAuth credentials". 
    - Provide your client Id and client Secret and Close. [Curtesy reference](https://monteledwards.com/2017/03/05/powershell-oauth-downloadinguploading-to-google-drive-via-drive-api/)  
    <img src= "../Images/RefreshTokenOwnOAuthCredentials.png">
    
    - From the left pane now click on Step1 and select "Contacts v3" -> "https://www.goggle.com/m8/feeds/
    - click Authroize APIs.

     <img src= "../Images/01ScopeContacts.png">
     
    - Oops we get an error. We forgot to give a redirect url while creating our tokens.
    <img src= "../Images/RedirectURLnotSetUp.png">
    - Go to your project (say MyProject). Click on Credentials and now click on the edit icon to edit the details in oAuth 2.0 ClientID.
    <img src= "../Images/EditCredentials.png">
    <img src= "../Images/AddRedirectURI.png">
    <img src= "../Images/AddedRedirectURI.png">
    - Now go back and try again with 'Step1' above to "Contacts v3" -> "https://www.goggle.com/m8/feeds/ and authorize APIs.
    - This time you should be able to get an authentical code as shown below. First it will ask for Google signin.

    <img src= "../Images/GoToAdvanced.png">
    <img src= "../Images/GoToMyProject.png">
    <img src= "../Images/Allow.png">
    <img src= "../Images/ConfirmAllow.png">
    
    - Exchange the authentication code for tokens.

    <img src= "../Images/ExchangeCodeForTokens.png">

    - Copy the refreh token from here and add to client-secret_****.json
    - Say add below  "client_secret": "abcdedfghijklmnopqur", as
                      "refresh_token": "1//04uYuNrwL0oN5CgYIARAAGAQSNwF-L9Irr8KeDh3g3yBOl6erDwSWKQPn_cJOfU2YwkRak5rqRZ7PRCr38CXOpi6xmjXaKSknT68",

    <img src= "../Images/AddRefreshTokenToJSON.png">
    - We are all set now to get the contacts from Google APIs.
